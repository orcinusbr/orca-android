/**
 * [Throwable] that defines a [Locale]-specific message which explains an issue in non-technical
 * vocabulary for non-engineers to be able to understand plainly what has happened and (possibly)
 * take action regarding the problem.
 *
 * [Exception]s caused by a [ReadableThrowable] are intended to be caught and have their [cause]s
 * explicitly and prominently presented to the user in the UI, explained by the localized version of
 * the message. Such explanation should adhere to the constraints specified in the
 * [messageResourceID] documentation.
 *
 * @property context [Context] from which default and localized messages are to be obtained.
 * @property messageResourceID Resource identifier of the message that explains in practical,
 *   intelligible terms what has gone wrong and, when applicable, the steps that can be taken by the
 *   user for the issue to be resolved. These instructions shall not rely on client-specific
 *   environment and/or configuration, as they may change over time and might make very accurate
 *   descriptions outdated rapidly; instead, focus on the *operations* that can be performed to
 *   mitigate the drawback, since these are supposed to be intuitively doable from the UI (e. g.,
 *   prefer "Feed couldn't be loaded at this moment. Try again by reloading." instead of "An error
 *   prevented the feed from being loaded. Swipe from the top to the bottom of the screen to
 *   reload.")
 *
 *   If this identifier isn't that of a [String] resource, a [Resources.NotFoundException] will be
 *   thrown when either the default or the localized message is retrieved.
 *
 * @property formatArgs Format arguments by which placeholders in the obtained [String] are
 *   replaced.
 * @see message
 * @see getLocalizedMessage
